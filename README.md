Book club companion app for the [Bibl.io Library API](https://github.com/vpmv/bibl.io) dev assignment.

This app is written in Symfony 7.1 in less than 2 hours, so expect (less than) nothing. I haven't had any hands-on experience with Sf for over 3 years. 

I'll update as soon as I gather more time.

Features
- The ugliest UI ever
- Zero features
- One scoped HTTP Client for communicating with Bibl.io
- One barely functional route (/search)
- A docker setup using [dunglas/symfony-docker](https://github.com/dunglas/symfony-docker)

Todo
- Everything

Requirements
- Docker
- PHP 8.4 optional

Enjoy! \o/
